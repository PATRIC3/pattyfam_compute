# PATRIC family computation

 1. Create base data directory with pf-construct-genus-data-for-genera
    This uses pf-build-nr to compute nonredundant databases, and pf-compute-nr-seqs
    to create sets of sequences corresponding to the reference sequence in the nonredundant
    sets.

 2. Use pf-submit-all-local families to start the local fam run.
